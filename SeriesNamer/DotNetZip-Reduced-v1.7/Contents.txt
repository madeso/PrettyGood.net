This is the Developer's Kit package for DotNetZip v1.7.  Packed Thu-05-14-2009--65106.61.  In this zip you will find a separate folder for each separate version of the DLL. In each folder there is a DLL, a PDB, and an XML file.  The DLL is the actual library, the PDB is the debug information, and the XML file is the intellisense doc for use within Visual Studio.
