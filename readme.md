# PrettyGood.net
Pretty good .net tools and libraries from around 2009-2011. Do not use, mostly just kept around for archival purposes.

# applications
TextLines - given a text input, can sort, trim, remove duplicate lines, poor mans gui version of various small linux tools for piping
RemoveEmptyDirectories - recursivly remove "empty" directories and/or recursivly show hidden files and directories
ShowAll - deprecated, recursivly show directories

HeaderParser - crappy dependency graph of included c++ headers visualized with graphviz tools
slndeps - generates a graphviz dependency from a vs2005 or vs2008 and runs graphviz's dot on it
slndeps2 - generates a graphviz dependency from a visual studio project, a improved version of slndeps for modernish solutions

Tagger - id3 tagging library and data extractor, but is missing a few dependencies so it won't build
SpotifyTest - tool to translate a spotify playlist to a m3u
BmiApp - program (in swedish) to calculate bmi and some other data
Builder - tool for running scripts and build things with enviroment variables from the user
CalenderApp - rainmeter like calender that sits on the desktop
Demo/LastFmApp - old demo of some last.fm interface (doesnt work anymore)
PathFinder - a explorer replacement merged with a terminal interface with autocompletion (sounds better than what it is)
RegView - ini parsing code without a viewer
Localization - custom reflection based localization, never figured out how to properly handle "arguments", missing a few files
