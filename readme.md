# PrettyGood.net

Pretty good .net tools and libraries from around 2009-2011. Do not use, mostly just kept around for archival purposes.

## Working (and potentially useful)


### TextLines
Given a text input, can sort, trim, remove duplicate lines, poor mans gui version of various small linux tools for piping

### RemoveEmptyDirectories
recursivly remove "empty" directories and/or recursivly show hidden files and directories

### HeaderParser
Generates a dependency graph of included c++ headers visualized with graphviz tools (complete with crappy c++ parsing)

### SeriesNamer
Extract meta data from files, format it and move the files based on the data extracted

### slndeps2
Generates a graphviz dependency from a visual studio project, a improved version of slndeps for modernish solutions

### BmiApp
Program (in swedish) to calculate bmi and some other data

### PathFinder
A explorer replacement merged with a terminal interface with autocompletion (sounds better than what it is)

---

## Build and runs (but doesn't really work)


### ShowAll
Recursivly show directories (deprecated)

### slndeps
Generates a graphviz dependency from a vs2005 or vs2008 and runs graphviz's dot on it

### SpotifyTest
Tool to translate a spotify playlist to a m3u

### Builder
Tool for running scripts and build things with enviroment variables from the user

### CalenderApp
Rainmeter like calender that sits on the desktop

### RegView
ini parsing code without a viewer

### Localization
Custom reflection based localization, never figured out how to properly handle "arguments", missing a few files

### LastFm/LastFmApp
Old demo of some last.fm interface (doesnt work anymore)

---

## Missing dependencies


### Tagger
id3 tagging library and data extractor, but is missing a few dependencies so it won't build

### Game
2d jame game (I think), doesn't build since dependencies have been updated

### Game3d
Simple 3d engine and tool, doesn't build anymore since dependencies have been updated
